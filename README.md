# Python Analysis Lessons

These 6 short (~ 1 hr) lessons have been designed to teach the basics of analysing data using Python. This is not meant to be a comprehensive guide in all techniques, but an introduction to provide the reader withe skills required to go and try things on their own.

Practice problems go with lessons from Lesson 3 onwards (i.e. Do Practice 1 after Lesson 3 etc...).

This is an iterative process, so feedback is welcome and will allow me to improve these lessons.

NOTE: I strongly recommend you download the Anaconda3 distribution of Python, then to open these notebooks, you need to open up Jupyter notebook and navigate to wherever you have downloaded them to.
